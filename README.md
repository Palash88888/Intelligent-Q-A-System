# 🌾 AgriInsight: Rainfall–Crop Production Analysis and Policy Intelligence System

## 📖 Overview
**AgriInsight** is a data-driven analytics system designed to provide deep insights into the relationship between **rainfall patterns** and **crop production trends** across Indian states.  
The project integrates climate and agricultural datasets to answer analytical, comparative, and policy-oriented questions for data-driven agricultural planning.

This system supports **state-wise, district-wise, and crop-wise** comparisons, correlation analyses, and visual interpretations for policymakers, researchers, and students.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Comparative Analysis:** Compare crop production across multiple states or districts.  
- 🌧️ **Rainfall Correlation:** Analyze the relationship between annual rainfall and crop productivity.  
- 🧭 **Trend Analysis:** Detect patterns in crop yield and rainfall variation over time.  
- 🏆 **Top Crop & Ranking:** Identify top-performing crops or districts by production volume.  
- 🧠 **Policy Insights:** Generate data-backed recommendations for drought-resistant or water-efficient crop policies.  
- 🔗 **Climate-Agriculture Synthesis:** Correlate climate variability with crop diversification trends.
